                        Our task management system will effectivly replace the I.T. teams old platform. With keeping
                        FERPA/HIPPA compliance in mind, our project will allow the district to effciently keep track
                        of the many tasks that come up each day. By doing so, we will improve the productivity of the
                        I.T. workers in the district, allowing for a better education experience for the children 
                        attending Seattle Public Schools.
