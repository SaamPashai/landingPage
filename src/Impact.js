                    Our task management application directly promotes the integrity of incident reporting 
                    metrics within the IT department in Seattle Public Schools. Departmental 
                    resources such as providing professional training, supporting projects, 
                    balancing IT assignments, and more, rely heavily on these metrics to effectively execute. 
                    By using this application separate from 
                    the currently misused incident system, these metrics will no longer be skewed. This ultimately 
                    affects classroom technology and its influence on student learning, where our project makes a 
                    positive impact for the teachers today as well as the students in current and future generations.
