                        Technology is being introduced to students and clasrooms earlier at every generation, and the Seattle 
                        Public Schools District's IT department play a critical role in making this happen. However, we have observed 
                        the misuse of current tools within the IT department that create for the inefficient distribution of important 
                        resources which ultimately pitfalls district performance.  Because of this, our goal is to create a product that 
                        the department can use that will allow them to better understand the data that influences those important resources, 
                        thus equipping the district with a tool to inherently make smarter business intelligence choices.
